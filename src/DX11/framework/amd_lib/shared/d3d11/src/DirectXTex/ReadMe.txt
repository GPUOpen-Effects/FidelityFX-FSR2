DIRECTX TEXTURE LIBRARY (DirectXTex)
------------------------------------

Copyright (c) Microsoft Corporation. All rights reserved.

October 30, 2015

This package contains DirectXTex, a shared source library for reading and writing DDS
files, and performing various texture content processing operations including
resizing, format conversion, mip-map generation, block compression for Direct3D runtime
texture resources, and height-map to normal-map conversion. This library makes
use of the Windows Image Component (WIC) APIs. It also includes a simple .TGA reader and
writer since this image file format is commonly used for texture content processing pipelines,
but is not currently supported by a built-in WIC codec.

The source is written for Visual Studio 2012, 2013, or 2015. It is recommended that
you make use of the Windows 8.1 SDK and Windows 7 Service Pack 1 or later.

NOTE: DirectXTex is not supported on Windows phone 8.0 because WIC is not available on
that platform. It is available on Windows phone starting in version 8.1.

DDSTextureLoader\
    This contains a streamlined version of the DirectX SDK sample DDSWithoutD3DX11 texture
    loading code for a simple light-weight runtime DDS loader. This version only supports
    Direct3D 11 and performs no runtime pixel data conversions (i.e. 24bpp legacy DDS files
    always fail). This is ideal for runtime usage, and supports the full complement of
    Direct3D 11 texture resources (1D, 2D, volume maps, cubemaps, mipmap levels,
    texture arrays, BC formats, etc.).

WICTextureLoader\
    This contains a Direct3D 11 2D texture loader that uses WIC to load a bitmap
    (BMP, JPEG, PNG, HD Photo, or other WIC supported file container), resize if needed
    based on the current feature level (or by explicit parameter), format convert to a
    DXGI_FORMAT if required, and then create a 2D texture. Furthermore, if a Direct3D 11
    device context is provided and the current device supports it for the given pixel format,
    it will auto-generate mipmaps. Note this does not support 1D textures, volume textures,
    cubemaps, or texture arrays. DDSTextureLoader is recommended for fully "precooked" textures
    for maximum performance and image quality, but this loader can be useful for creating
    simple 2D texture from standard image files at runtime.

    Note: This function is not thread-safe if given a non-NULL device context for the auto-gen
    mip-map support.

DirectXTex\
    This contains the DirectXTex library. This includes a full-featured DDS reader and writer
    including legacy format conversions, a TGA reader and writer, a WIC-based bitmap reader and
    writer (BMP, JPEG, PNG, TIFF, and HD Photo), and various texture processing functions. This
    is intended primarily for tool usage.

    Note that the majority of the header files here are intended for internal implementation
    of the library only (BC.h, DDS.h, DirectXTexP.h, and scoped.h). Only DirectXTex.h is
    meant as a 'public' header for the library.

Texconv\
    This DirectXTex sample is an implementation of the "texconv" command-line texture utility
    from the DirectX SDK utilizing DirectXTex rather than D3DX.

    It supports the same arguments as the Texture Conversion Tool Extended (texconvex.exe) DirectX
    SDK utility. See <http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ee422506.aspx>. The primary differences
    are the -10 and -11 arguments are not applicable; the filter names (POINT, LINEAR, CUBIC,
    FANT or BOX, TRIANGLE, *_DITHER, *_DITHER_DIFFUSION); and support for the .TGA file format.
    This also includes support for JPEG XR/HD Photo bitmap formats (see
    <http://blogs.msdn.com/b/chuckw/archive/2011/01/19/known-issue-texconvex.aspx>)

Texassemble\
    This DirectXTex sample is a command-line utility for creating cubemaps, volume maps, or
    texture arrays from a set of individual input image files.
    
DDSView\
    This DirectXTex sample is a simple Direct3D 11-based viewer for DDS files. For array textures
    or volume maps, the "<" and ">" keyboard keys will show different images contained in the DDS.
    The "1" through "0" keys can also be used to jump to a specific image index.

RELEASE NOTES

* The alpha mode specification for DDS files was updated between the March 2013 and April 2013 releases. Any
  DDS files created using the DDS_FLAGS_FORCE_DX10_EXT_MISC2 flag or the texconv -dx10 switch using the
  March 2013 release should be refreshed.

* Due to the underlying Windows BMP WIC codec, alpha channels are not supported for 16bpp or 32bpp BMP pixel format files. The Windows 8.x
  version of the Windows BMP WIC codec does support 32bpp pixel formats with alpha when using the BITMAPV5HEADER file header. Note the updated
  WIC is available on Windows 7 SP1 with KB 2670838 installed.

* While DXGI 1.0 and DXGI 1.1 include 5:6:5 (DXGI_FORMAT_B5G6R5_UNORM) and 5:5:5:1 (DXGI_FORMAT_B5G5R5A1_UNORM)
  pixel format enumerations, the DirectX 10.x and 11.0 Runtimes do not support these formats for use with Direct3D. The DirectX 11.1 runtime,
  DXGI 1.2, and the WDDM 1.2 driver model fully support 16bpp formats (5:6:5, 5:5:5:1, and 4:4:4:4).

* WICTextureLoader cannot load .TGA files unless the system has a 3rd party WIC codec installed. You must use the DirectXTex
  library for TGA file format support without relying on an add-on WIC codec.

* Loading of 96bpp floating-point TIFF files results in a corrupted image prior to Windows 8. This fix is available on Windows 7 SP1 with
  KB 2670838 installed.
