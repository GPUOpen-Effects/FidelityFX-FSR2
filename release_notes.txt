FidelityFX Super Resolution 2.1.1
=================================

Features
--------
- Reactivity mask interpretation has been modified to give game developers more levers to alleviate ghosting and other artefacts.
- Sample has example use of Reactivity mask.
- Sample has example use of Transparency and Composition mask.
- Sample has particles and animated textures.

Changes
-------
- Reactivity mask now uses full range of value in the mask (0.0 - 1.0).
- Reactivity and Composition and Transparency mask dialation is now based on input colors to avoid expanding reactiveness into non-relevant upscaled areas.
- Disocclusion logic improved in order to detect disocclusions in areas with very small depth deparation.
- RCAS Pass forced to fp32 mode to reduce chance of issues seen with HDR input values.
- Fix for display-resolution motion vectors interpretation.
- FP16/FP32 computation review, readjusting balance of fp16/fp32 for maximum quality.
- Amended motion vector description within the documentation.
- Various documentation edits for spelling.
- Clarified the frame delta time input value within the readme documentation.
- Fixed issue with bad memset within the shader blob selection logic.
- Fix issue with reprojection data on a reset.

Limitations
-----------
- The precise configuration and contents of the reactivity mask is subject to change in a future version of FSR2.

Known issues
------------
- The Vulkan version of the FSR2 sample application experiences a crash on Intel i9-10900K products.
- The Vulkan version of the FSR2 sample application experiences a crash when using the function keys to toggle between scaling modes on some NVIDIA hardware.
